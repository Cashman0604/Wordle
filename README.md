# Wordle
A Wordle program that both runs and solves games of Wordle
The accuracy of the solver can be tested against the game
inside the Java version using a specific word.
There is also a python version of the game, but no python
solver.
The Java-based Wordle was a personal project I had. The
python version, however, was an assignment for a class, but
I thought it would fit well in this repository.
